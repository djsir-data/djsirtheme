# djsirtheme

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `djsirtheme` is to enable users to easily create ggplot2 and
highcharts charts that are consistent with the style guide of the
Victorian Department of Jobs, Skills, Industry and Regions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `djsirtheme` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("djsir-data/djsirtheme")
```

<!-- ## Example -->
<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->
<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- #library(djsirtheme) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->
<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->
<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
