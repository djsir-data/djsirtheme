\title{Don't expand below the y axis / to the left of the x-axis.}
\usage{
djsir_y_continuous(expand_bottom = 0, expand_top = 0.015, ...)

djsir_x_continuous(expand_left = 0, expand_right = 0.015, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{expand_bottom}{default is 0. This will ensure that your x-axis is at
the bottom value of your plotted data. Increase to add some buffer between
the lowest point in your data and the x-axis. Note that the value is
interpreted as a fraction of the total plotting space - a value of 1 will
add white space equal to the whole area of your data.}

\item{expand_top}{default is 0.015. This will ensure that a small amount of
white space is added to the top of your chart. Increase to add more white
space.}

\item{...}{arguments passed to scale_y_continuous or scale_x_continuous}

\item{expand_left}{default is 0. This will ensure your y-axis is at the
lowest value of your plotted value.}

\item{expand_right}{default is 0.015. This will ensure that a small amount of
white space is added to the right of your chart.}

\description{
These functions are particularly useful for bar charts and similar charts
with a zero baseline.
}
\examples{

# Here's a basic chart in the DJSIR style:
library(ggplot2)

p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_djsir()

# By default our chart (p) will have a little whitespace below the
# 10 on the y axis. Remove that with:

p +
  djsir_y_continuous()

# These functions are particularly useful with bar charts
library(dplyr)
p2 <- iris \%>\%
  group_by(Species) \%>\%
  summarise(length = mean(Sepal.Length)) \%>\%
  ggplot(aes(x = Species, y = length)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_djsir()

# p2 has space below the 0 line, which we don't want
p2 +
  djsir_y_continuous()
